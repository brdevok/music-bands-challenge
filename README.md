# Music Bands React Challenge

This proyect is the result of a React challenge, it uses a small API of music bands to create a list of bands and display extra information when clicked, also it has a simple login system with fake back-end logic to simulate authorization restrictions.

The site demo is mounted on github pages, you can see it on live with the link below:
